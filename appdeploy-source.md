# Deploying your app from source code
{: #app-source-code}

You can deploy your application directly from source code with the {{site.data.keyword.codeenginefull}} console and CLI. Your source code can be located Find out what advantages are available when you [build your image with {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-faqs#dockerbld-cebuild).

## Deploying your app from source code
{: #deploy-app-source-code}

You can deploy your application directly from source code with the console. Find out what advantages are available when you [build your image with {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-faqs#dockerbld-cebuild).
{: shortdesc}

Before you begin, [plan for your build](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-plan-build). You can also find [tips for creating a Dockerfile](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-dockerfile).

{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} can automatically push images to {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} namespaces in your account and even create a namespace for you. To push images to a different {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} account or to a private Docker Hub account, see [Adding access to a private container registry](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-add-registry).

1. Open the [{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}](https://cloud.ibm.com/codeengine/overview){: external} console.
2. Select **Start creating** from **Start from source code**.
3. Select **Application**.
4. Enter a name for the application. Use a name for your application that is unique within the project. 
5. Select a project from the list of available projects. You can also [create a new one](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-manage-project#create-a-project). Note that you must have a selected project to deploy an app.
6. Select **Source code**.
7. Click **Specify build details**.
8. Select a source repository, for example, `https://github.com/IBM/CodeEngine`. You can optionally provide a branch name. If you do not provide a branch name and you leave the field empty, {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} automatically uses the default branch of the specified repository. Click **Next**.  
9. Select a strategy for your build and resources for your build. For more information about build options, see [Planning your build](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-plan-build). Click **Next**.
10. Select a container registry location, such as `IBM Registry, Dallas` to specify where to store the image of your build output. If your registry is private, you must [set up access](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-add-registry) to it.
11. Select an existing **Registry access secret** or create a new one. If you are building your image to a {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} instance that is in your account, you can select `{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} managed secret` and let {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} create and manage the secret for you.
12. Select a namespace, name, and a tag for your image.
13. Click **Done**.
14. Modify any runtime settings or environment variables for your app. For more information about these options, see [Options for endpoint visibility of apps](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-application-workloads#optionsdeploy) and [Options for deploying an app](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-application-workloads#optionsdeploy).
15. Click **Create**.
16. After your build run is submitted, the built container image is sent to {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} and then your application pulls the image and deploys for you. After the application status changes to **Ready**, you can test the application. Click **Test application** and then click **Send request** in the Test application pane. To open the application in a web page, click **Application URL**.  

Now that you have deployed your application, you can view information about application revisions and any running instances, and configuration details.

## Next steps for apps
{: #nextsteps-appdeploysource}

For more information about apps, see [Deploying applications](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-application-workloads).

Now that you have deployed your app, you can use event subscriptions to make your apps event-driven, so that your apps are triggered by [periodic schedules](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-subscribe-cron#eventing-cron-existing-app) or react to events like [file uploads](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-eventing-cosevent-producer#obstorage_ev_app).
