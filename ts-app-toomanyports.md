# Why does my port scan show more open ports than expected?
{: #ts-app-toomanyports}
{: troubleshoot}


If you perform a port scan on an endpoint for a {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} component, the result includes more open network ports than expected. 
{: tsSymptoms}

For incoming connections that use HTTP, the transport layer security (TLS) aspects are managed automatically by {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} outside of the application code. In particular, {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} uses {{site.data.keyword.cis_short}} in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, which is based on CloudFlare, as the intrusion prevention system (IPS) for DNS and DDOS protection on Layer 4. In other words, the TCP/IP connection that is established on the IPS is owned and managed by Cloudflare. 
{: tsCauses}

{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} exposes only ports `443` (HTTPS) and `80` (HTTP) for application endpoints on Layer 3, Layer 4, and Layer 7. As a result, any other ports, which are opened by Cloudflare, are not being used or routed to the application. If your scanning tool reports open ports, other than `443` and `80`, then the scanning tool is scanning the Cloudflare IP and not the {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} application endpoint. 

To resolve this issue, consider blocking your network traffic on ports other than `80` and `443`. For more information, see [Cloudflare documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/reference/network-ports/#how-to-block-traffic-on-additional-ports){: external} 
{: tsResolve}

Cloudflare has a large infrastructure and resolves IP addresses depending on the client location to serve traffic worldwide. To learn about IP ranges for Cloudflare, see [Cloudfare documentation - IP ranges](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/){: external}.
