# Subscribing to event producers
{: #subscribing-events}

Oftentimes in distributed environments you want your applications or jobs to react to messages (events) that are generated from other components, which are usually called event producers. With {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}}, your applications or jobs can receive events of interest as HTTP POST requests by subscribing to event producers.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} supports two types of event producers. 

**Ping (cron)**: The Ping event producer is based on cron and generates an event at regular intervals. Use a Ping event producer when an action needs to be taken at well-defined intervals or at specific times.

**{{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}**: The {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} event producer generates events as changes are made to the objects in your object storage buckets. For example, as objects are added to a bucket, an application can receive an event and then perform an action based on that change, perhaps consuming that new object.

Apps can subscribe to multiple event producers, but only one app can receive events from each subscription. Note that subscriptions can affect how an application scales. For more information, see [Configuring application scaling](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-app-scale).

{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} provides custom resource definition (CRD) methods. For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} API reference - Subscription CRD methods](/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-api#api-crd-subscription).

## HTTP headers and body information for events
{: #sub-header-body}

All events that are delivered to applications are received as HTTP messages. Events contain certain HTTP headers that help you to quickly determine key bits of information about the events without looking at the body (business logic) of the event. For more information, see the [`CloudEvents` spec](https://cloudevents.io){: external}.
{: shortdesc}

### Common HTTP header
{: #sub-common-header}

The following table shows the common HTTP headers that appear in each event that is delivered. The actual set of headers included in each event may include more options. For more information and more header file options, see the [`CloudEvent` attributes](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.1/spec.md#context-attributes){: external}. 

```
ce-id:Â  c329ed76-5004-4383-a3cc-c7a9b82e3ac6
ce-source: /apis/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/pingsources/myping
ce-specversion: 1.0
ce-time: 2021-02-26T19:19:00.497637287Z
ce-type: dev.knative.sources.ping
```
{: screen}

The following table describes the common headers.

| Header   | Description      | 
|----------|------------------|
| `ce-id` | A unique identifier for the event, unless an event is replayed, in which case, it is assigned the same ID. | 
| `ce-source` | A URI-reference that indicates where this event originated from within the event producer. |
| `ce-specversion` | The version of the Cloud Events spec. This value is always `1.0`. |
| `ce-time` | The time that the event was generated. |
| `ce-type` | The type of the event. For example, did a `write` or `delete` action occur. |
